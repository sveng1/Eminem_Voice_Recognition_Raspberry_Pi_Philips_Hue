# Eminem_Voice_Recognition_Raspberry_Pi_Philips_Hue

A while ago I had an incident where a friend and I were relaxing on the couch, listening to music just flowing from Spotify. A song comes on and I say "Is that Eminem?". My friends says "yeah I think it's Eminem", and I'm like "No, I'm not sure it's him", "I'm pretty sure it's him" and so on, and eventually we have to go check on her phone find out whether or not it is Eminem singing. 

It was a very uncomfortable situation, and to make sure it doesn't happen again, I have now set up a system in my apartment that tells me whenever it is Eminem singing or rapping on my speaker. 

A voice recognition model trained on Eminem's voice and other sounds is running on a Raspberry Pi, and every time it detects Eminem's voice, it changes the Philips Hue light bulps in my apartment to light blue (because, as everyone knows, light blue is Eminem's favourite color). Now I can finally relax and don't have to embarrass myself by having to check on my phone if it the music playing is really Eminem.
